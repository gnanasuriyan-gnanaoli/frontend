1. Responsive Web Design
  1. Use % instead of fixed width, use viewport relative units(vw, vh, vmin, vmax)
  2. When you want a fixed width for larger resolutions, use max-width, not width, so it can still adapt to smaller ones without media queries.
  3. Replaced Elements - img, iframe, object, video, Always set their max-width: to 100%
